# Cost-Benefit_Analysis
The project conducts a cost-benefit analysis on dam constructions, calculating benefits, costs, and using triangular distribution for simulations. It evaluates financial viability and decision-making.

The project undertakes a cost-benefit analysis for two hypothetical dam constructions using the triangular probability distribution to assess potential financial outcomes. It involves calculating specific parameters such as the differences between the upper limit, lower limit, and peak of expected benefits and costs. Through simulating 10,000 records with generated random numbers, the analysis aims to derive theoretical means for each scenario. By applying triangular distribution calculations to these simulations, the project estimates total costs, total benefits, and subsequently, the benefit-cost ratio for each dam, informing on their financial viability.

The analysis progresses by determining frequency distributions for each dam, using calculated minimum and maximum ranges and class width values to create tabular and graphical representations. These frequency distributions visually depict the potential financial outcomes, helping to assess the likelihood of each dam's success under the given financial parameters. A chi-square goodness fit test is then applied to evaluate the appropriateness of the triangular probability distribution model. Despite a chi-square test statistic value suggesting the model may not be a perfect fit, further calculations indicate one dam's potential to yield better financial outcomes over the other, guiding decision-making regarding their construction.
